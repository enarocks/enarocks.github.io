      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote this almost 2 years ago, angry after a conference in a hotel room. I’ve cleaned it up a bit and added some recent events, but it remains largely unchanged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was in university studying computer science all anyone wanted to talk about was ML. I was not that interested, but I noticed it more and more from students and recruiters and job listings. ML was going to change and improve everything about the world, drastically. I don’t think I heard anyone really propose a plan for that, the technology was still progressing. But of course, it was going to be the next big thing, all the companies and universities had to hop on it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
