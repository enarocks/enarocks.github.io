      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-august-long-weekend-2025-08-01-to-2025-08-04&#34;&gt;The August Long Weekend (2025-08-01 to 2025-08-04)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the long weekend, I was kind of dreading it. Sure, I had taken the Friday off work and monday is a civic holiday, so then I would have a 4 day weekend, but I didn’t have any other plans. My boyfriend Alex is going backpacking in Lake Superior and would barely have any signal, my local friends were all out of town, and it would be just me and my 2 cats (which I do love). It’s also actually 3 cats, because I’m going to checkup on my friend’s cat over the weekend too to make sure she’s doing well and has water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
