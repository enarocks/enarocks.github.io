      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;2025&#34;&gt;2025&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little “ena wrapped” for 2025! I spent most of 2024 unable to do anything due to an injury, and slowly ramped up my ability to do things like sewing again in 2025. It was a really fun year. I don’t feel like going in depth into everything, but I’ll highlight my favourites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;quickly-before-the-crafts-reading&#34;&gt;Quickly before the crafts: Reading!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love the easy graphs Storygraph gives me. I read a LOT in January because for Christmas 2024 I got a Kobo, then it slowed down a bit through the year. I’m hoping to read one more book before the end of the year, but it might look less likely now, oops. I only gave 2 books 5 stars (both in murderbot) and that is a big drop from last year. I procrastinated reading a lot of good books and instead just read a lot of fun silly books, which rarely get 5 stars from me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>August Long Weekend</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;written over the days of 2025-08-01 to 2025-08-04&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the August long weekend, I was dreading it. I took friday off work in advance and monday was a civic holiday, so I was supposed to be looking forward to a 4 day weekend&amp;hellip; but I didn’t have any plans. My boyfriend Alex is going backpacking at Lake Superior and would barely have any signal, my local friends were all out of town, and it would be just me and my 2 cats (which I normally don&amp;rsquo;t mind). It’s also actually 3 cats, because I have to checkup on my friend’s cat occasionally to make sure she’s doing well and has water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Knitting and Crocheting my own Duke Sucellus slippers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d start off easy with my first post, and share a pair of slippers I made based off an item in (old school) runescape. I took a lot of notes since I had to do everything twice to make a pair of slippers, so here is my pattern write-up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize this is a really niche topic, this pattern requires you to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;know how to knit&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;know how to crochet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;like Old School Runescape&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;but I wanted to explore my thought process &amp;amp; how the project went, which I think can be universally applicable to a lot of different fibre craft backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
