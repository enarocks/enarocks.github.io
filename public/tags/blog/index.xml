      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;written over the days of 2025-08-01 to 2025-08-04&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the August long weekend, I was dreading it. I took friday off work in advance and monday was a civic holiday, so I was supposed to be looking forward to a 4 day weekend&amp;hellip; but I didn’t have any plans. My boyfriend Alex is going backpacking at Lake Superior and would barely have any signal, my local friends were all out of town, and it would be just me and my 2 cats (which I normally don&amp;rsquo;t mind). It’s also actually 3 cats, because I have to checkup on my friend’s cat occasionally to make sure she’s doing well and has water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
