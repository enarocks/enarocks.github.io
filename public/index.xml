      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little “ena wrapped” for 2025! I spent most of 2024 unable to do anything due to an injury, and slowly ramped up my ability to do things like sewing again in 2025. It was a really fun year. I don’t feel like going in depth into absolutely everything, but I’ll highlight my favourites and most challenging projects, and also throw in some fun statistics like &amp;ldquo;do I actually use these things still?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Musings on my first time quitting a job</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I mentioned I was stressed over an interview. Well, I ended up getting an offer and accepted it, and have since officially quit my previous job. I start the new job on the upcoming Monday. Summarizing it like that makes it sound like it was a fun and easy process, but I’ve been so incredibly anxious and stressed I feel myself returning to my high school levels of anxiety. This applies to all aspects of my life, not just work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>August Long Weekend</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;written over the days of 2025-08-01 to 2025-08-04&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the August long weekend, I was dreading it. I took friday off work in advance and monday was a civic holiday, so I was supposed to be looking forward to a 4 day weekend&amp;hellip; but I didn’t have any plans. My boyfriend Alex is going backpacking at Lake Superior and would barely have any signal, my local friends were all out of town, and it would be just me and my 2 cats (which I normally don&amp;rsquo;t mind). It’s also actually 3 cats, because I have to checkup on my friend’s cat occasionally to make sure she’s doing well and has water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote this almost 2 years ago, angry after a conference in a hotel room. I’ve cleaned it up a bit and added some recent events, but it remains largely unchanged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was in university studying computer science all anyone wanted to talk about was ML. I was not that interested, but I noticed it more and more from students and recruiters and job listings. ML was going to change and improve everything about the world, drastically. I don’t think I heard anyone really propose a plan for that, the technology was still progressing. But of course, it was going to be the next big thing, all the companies and universities had to hop on it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Knitting and Crocheting my own Duke Sucellus slippers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d start off easy with my first post, and share a pair of slippers I made based off an item in (old school) runescape. I took a lot of notes since I had to do everything twice to make a pair of slippers, so here is my pattern write-up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize this is a really niche topic, this pattern requires you to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;know how to knit&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;know how to crochet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;like Old School Runescape&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;but I wanted to explore my thought process &amp;amp; how the project went, which I think can be universally applicable to a lot of different fibre craft backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Ena and I suppose I rock! I am a software engineer with a lot of hobbies, and this is my miscellaneous blog. There is no theme or common interest, it&amp;rsquo;s about whatever is interesting me, which is a wide range of topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One day I&amp;rsquo;ll add more features (RSS, comments?, etc) but feel free to message me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.social/@enarocks&#34;&gt;mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
