Hi, I'm Ena and I suppose I rock! I am a software engineer with a lot of hobbies, and this is my miscellaneous blog. There is no theme or common interest, it's about whatever is interesting me, which is a wide range of topics.

One day I'll add more features (RSS, comments?, etc) but feel free to message me on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@enarocks).
