Hi, I'm Ena (ɛnə not ina) and I suppose I rock! I am a software engineer with a lot of hobbies, and this is my miscellaneous blog. There is no theme or common interest, it's about whatever is interesting me, which is a wide range of topics. I am *not* a frontend developer so this website is pretty basic, I might slowly improve it. 

I'm told this link will allow you hook up an RSS feed as you desire: https://ena.rocks/index.xml

Feel free to message me on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@enarocks).
