# The Plan

Leading up to the August long weekend, I was dreading it. I took friday off work in advance and monday was a civic holiday, so I was supposed to be looking forward to a 4 day weekend... but I didn‚Äôt have any plans. My boyfriend Alex is going backpacking at Lake Superior and would barely have any signal, my local friends were all out of town, and it would be just me and my 2 cats (which I normally don't mind). It‚Äôs also actually 3 cats, because I have to checkup on my friend‚Äôs cat occasionally to make sure she‚Äôs doing well and has water.

I usually enjoy spending time alone, in fact spending too much time with people makes my brain feels like goo. But I'm only alone this weekend due to the back injury I'm recovering from, otherwise I could have also gone camping with Alex. (I don't even know if I would've gone, I've never been backpacking, but not having the option is frustrating, ok!)

Also there is a large part of me that‚Äôs worried I would spend the entire weekend in a runescape-fueled haze, playing for 14 hours straight without breaks and eating poorly without anyone around to help regulate or engage me in you know‚Ä¶ the *real world*.

Then I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZob4P9BOjw) by caricakes (I usually watch her book content, not her vlog content) and was inspired by her talking about sharing photos of your trips with people you wish were there with you, while solo traveling. Technically I'm not the one traveling, but it still made sense to my brain. (I still don‚Äôt think I could handle going to a restaurant alone).

So this is my blog, both an attempt to hold me accountable to actually do non-runescape things (although it‚Äôs fine to play *some* runescape), and a cute little newsletter I can show my boyfriend when he gets back about all the things I got up to since I can‚Äôt really text him all weekend. 

{{< line-break >}} 

My plan for the weekend is to gamify it  and challenge myself to do the following every day:

- 1-2 chores (non-fun things)
- 1-2 fun things (that aren‚Äôt runescape)
- Do something more engaging on my walks
- Check in here every morning & evening

I‚Äôm trying not to make it too ambitious (I may very well do more than 1-2 of both category) but I prefer to make the expectations low and then exceed them than to fail to meet them.

I already do 2 walks a day as part of my physiotherapy for my back injury, but I want to try to walk to a cafe a bit further away, or maybe go to a park and read for a little bit. Basically, get more outside time because it‚Äôs been so melting hot and humid recently I‚Äôve been slacking. Although the last couple days have been less suffocatingly humid, so that's an improvement.

Also I hope that by forcing myself to check in both morning and evening, maybe it‚Äôll help me wind down in the evenings and wake up in the mornings, and not result in me ruining my regular sleep. I tend to sleep poorly when Alex is away because it‚Äôs hard to turn my brain off and fall asleep.

A vague outline of options for the weekend:

| **Fun things** | **Not fun things (chores)** |
| --- | --- |
| Finish/make progress sewing my darcy bloomers | Fold laundry |
| Finish/make progress on knitting my norma sweater | Change sheets |
| Try out cultist simulator (I‚Äôm nervous for some reason, despite loving book of hours, it seems intimidating) | Clean the kitchen |
| Knit my cotton yarn swatch | Clean the dining table |
| Knit my planned mittens swatch | Vacuum (all rooms.. but mainly the kitchen and by the litter boxes) |
| Go to the library | Organize my closet |
| Read in a park | Take out the recycling |
| Read at all | Organize my fabric stash better |
| Check on my friend‚Äôs cat | Organize the bookshelves better |
| Knit/read in a cafe | Go grocery shopping (I have to do this by saturday, because they‚Äôll be closed sunday and monday) |
| Draw anything‚Ä¶ anything at all, for any length of time, in any medium | Deep clean the fridge |
| Make [japanese potato salad](https://youtu.be/gieX2LksCYU) (maybe on monday so alex can have some the next day) | Transfer a candle to a smaller container so I can use the rest of the remaining wax (this is kind of fun, but I‚Äôve been procrastinating it) |
|  | Clean the bathroom  |

I‚Äôm not plannong to do even 50% of these things, but I wanted an easy reference with lots of ideas to look at when I run out of inspiration or motivation.

# Friday (Aug 1)

## Morning ‚òÄÔ∏è

It's day 1 and I'm already writing this a bit later than I planned (it‚Äôs currently 10:20am) because Alex was getting ready to head out and it was a bit chaotic. I also got up earlier than usual and kind of puttered around trying to make coffee but doing steps wrong because I was tired. Alex ended up making our coffees instead. We had a quick breakfast, and then we said goodbye! I did a bit of knitting and then wrote the intro you just read.

When I came up with this plan, my original idea was to start of Friday by going to the library and getting a random book, then spend the weekend reading it. It's the exact sort of cozy and whimsy I'm trying to bring more of into my life. Unfortunately, I have a job interview (non-technical, but still need to be ready for it) at 2pm, and it‚Äôs killed my motivation to do anything more exciting beforehand because then I‚Äôll need to keep an eye on a clock. Having to look at clocks kills all the fun vibes. Also I walked to the library last night for a cute market event, and I‚Äôm kind of lazy to do the same route again. I wish my bike wasn't currently broken.

So I think I‚Äôll just go to the library tomorrow instead, have a chill day until 2pm, and then see what I feel like doing after. I might do some runescape to stop overthinking everything I said (god I hate interviews, they drain me mentally in a way nothing else does).

For daily chores: I‚Äôm definitely counting the interview as a chore because I do want the job but I really don‚Äôt want to do the interview. Maybe I should count it as double points. Does paying rent count as a chore? Because I did that, but I‚Äôm not sure I should get credit for it. I don‚Äôt need to do groceries today, I‚Äôll go tomorrow instead, I‚Äôll just make some new rice to eat with leftover curry. I think I‚Äôll aim to fold and put away the laundry I ran yesterday and also clean the kitchen.

For fun things‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in the mood to knit because I‚Äôm almost done the ribbing on my sleeve. But my shoulders are a bit sore, so I don‚Äôt want to do that all day. I don‚Äôt have a book to read in the park yet. I‚Äôll check in on my friend‚Äôs cat on my afternoon walk, and try to get some sewing done because I‚Äôm not far off finishing my current project ([darcy bloomers](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1688446813/darcy-bloomers-pdf-sewing-pattern-xs-6xl)) which I‚Äôm excited for because they‚Äôre kind of whimsical shorts for under dresses (or just as pyjamas).

The interview looming over me is really putting a damper in my plans, I‚Äôm not feeling as ambitious as I was before it was scheduled on Wednesday. Hopefully once it‚Äôs over I can focus more on the creative things I wanted to do.

## Evening üåö

| **Fun things completed** | **Chores completed** | 
| --- | --- |
| Knit my cotton swatch (not yet blocked - 0.5) | Folded laundry |
| Cast off my first sleeve on sweater | Watched and changed bed sheets |
| Played runescape | Cleaned kitchen, did dishes |
| Checked on my friend‚Äôs cat | Did my interview |
|  | Prepped a package for return | 

Honestly, today was not really the best day. After my interview I tried to destress with some runescape but I kept overthinking everything I said. It honestly went fine, nothing bad, I think I did fine. Good enough to proceed? Who knows. But all the thoughts kept circling in my head and it was tricky to disconnect. I did get a little phonecall with Alex before he goes more off grid, which was nice to get some of my overthinking thoughts out and have him comfort me.

I did get a lot done though! That‚Äôs an accomplishment! Also a decent amount of runescape! I‚Äôd call that a win/win. 

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/swatch.PNG" alt="a test square of knitting in bright pink" class="centre" width="75%" >}}

My test swatch looks great! A friend gave me advice on how to remember which side I did with which needles. I‚Äôm not sure my plan for this yarn (I got a ton of colours from a thrift store for very cheap which is great because I want to do a scrappy cotton tank top), but also the yarn label is so wrong about the weight I needed to test it before I could even start planning.

The yarn is Hobbi Rainbow 8/4 which says it's a super fine (1) but also has 2.5-3.5mm as the recommended needle size. I'm sorry but 3.5mm is not a super fine yarn. I'd consider it more sport weight. I didn‚Äôt block it yet, although I doubt it‚Äôll change much, I‚Äôll do that tomorrow.

My Norma sweater at the start of the weekend:
{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/sweater1.jpg" width="75%" class="centre" >}}

My Norma sweater at the end of day 1:
{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/sweater2.jpg" width="75%" class="centre" >}}

Also I think I might actually be able to finish my sweater this weekend? I have 2 more stripes and the ribbing left on one sleeve.. that‚Äôs super attainable, and super exciting for it to be ready for the fall. I‚Äôm gonna wear it non stop, I love the colours so much. But it‚Äôs not a big deal if it takes a couple more days.

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/bed.PNG" alt="bed before/after sheets with a helpful cat assistant" width=75%" class="centre" >}}

I was super motivated to do the laundry and change the sheets because our new seersucker sheets arrived and I wanted to put them on. It was difficult though‚Ä¶ we have a very comfortable bed that is also 5000 pounds and is difficult to manoeuvre alone, not even to mention having a bad back. I was literally huffing and puffing BUT I DID IT! Zlatko gets all the credit for being my helpful (really unhelpful) assistant. I also did both my physio walks, but I didn‚Äôt do my physio exercises. I was too tired, I‚Äôll definitely do them tomorrow.

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/cuddly.jpg" width="50%" alt="My friend's cat cuddling up in my armpit" class="centre" >}}

My friend‚Äôs cat was super affectionate when I went to visit her, although she eventually remembered I was a stranger and got a bit scared of me. I'm gonna try and spend a bit more time with her tomorrow, since she seems lonely. (Alex, when you get to this part pause and watch all the videos I took. There‚Äôs too many to put here, but you‚Äôll want to watch all of them).

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/catlaps.PNG" alt="both cats on top of me, zlatko not looking super happy" class="centre" width="75%" >}}

Highlight of the day was definitely having two cats on top of me for a very brief instant. Zlatko (orange cat, 16) doesn‚Äôt really appreciate how much Riki (black cat, 2) loves him. She‚Äôs his biggest fan girl (only tied with me).

I‚Äôm also still committed to the library tomorrow, and I need to go grocery shopping because they‚Äôll be closed sunday and monday. See you then! I hope to sleep well despite all the interview jitters.

# Saturday

## Morning ‚òÄÔ∏è

I may have accidentally stayed up too late last night yapping with a friend. If the goal was not to stay up too late because I was struggling to sleep, technically I didn't do that? My cats woke me up at 9am so that's not too bad.

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/cats2.jpg" width="50%" class="centre" alt="the cats lounging happily on the new bedsheets" >}}

The grocery store closes at 6 but I am determined to make it to library today, so I forced myself to get up at and headed out at 10am so I could rest before groceries. 

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/bagel.jpg" width="50%" class="centre" alt="an everything bagel and a coffee" >}}

I got bagels and coffee before I went to the library. I immediately ate a tuna with crispy onions and got a strawberry and blueberry one to eat later.

Then I headed over to the library. My goal was deliberately to get a book I had never heard of before. It gets tiring how all book reviews online tend to cover the same books, with all the book people I follow are all reading the same book at the same time. I get it - you see a good review, you want to read it. But I wanted to actively chose a book I knew basically nothing about.

I found that this was actually a pretty difficult challenge because the library only had a "fiction" & a "non fiction" section. I was in the mood for a fantasy book, but there was only vibes of the spine to go off to guess what a book was about.

I wandered for a bit and then ended up picking a book I found in the new section called ‚ÄúThe Cautious Travelers Guide  to the Wastelands‚Äù by ‚ÄúSarah Brooks‚Äù. 

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/book1.PNG" width="50%" class="centre" alt="The cover of the book, green and quite simple" >}}

*It is said there is a price that every passenger must pay. A price beyond the cost of a ticket.*

*It is the end of the 19th Century and the world is awash with marvels. But there is nothing so marvellous as the Wastelands: a terrain of terrible miracles that lies between Beijing and Moscow.*

*Nothing touches this abandoned wilderness except the Great Trans-Siberian Express: an impenetrable train built to carry cargo across continents, but which now transports anyone who dares to cross the shadowy Wastelands.*

*On to the platform steps a curious cast of characters: a grieving woman with a borrowed name, a famous child born on the train and a disgraced naturalist, all heading for the Great Exhibition in Moscow.*

*But the old rules are changing, and there are whispers that the train isn't safe. As secrets and stories begin to unravel the passengers and crew must survive their journey through the Wastelands together, even as something uncontrollable seems to be breaking in . . .*

{{<line-break>}}

I'm not actually sure if it is a fantasy or some kind of alternate reality, the blurb didn't really tell me, but that's even more intriguing. What really got me though is that the book takes place on a train. Who doesn't love trains? And it's the trans-siberian express, which is always a great atmosphere. And then when I saw the book had a little map of the train, and I knew this was the book I was going to read. 

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/book2.jpg" width="75%" class="centre" alt="A map layout of the book and what order the cabins are in" >}}

(At first I thought it was weird first class was at the rear of the train, I feel like usually first class is in the front. Think planes or modern trains, that's the layout I always see. But I also think this is historically accurate? because trains back then were coal-polluting, loud nightmares, and the first class wanted to be as far as possible from the engine itself. Although I don't know if this book is historical. Probably at least a little, I doubt someone's going to pull out an iPhone. (edit: the summary says 19th century, I don't know how I missed that))

Now I'm at the park, writing this annoyingly on my phone, because it's 11:57 and I was supposed to write this when I got up but I was tired and also trying to head out earlier so I could rest before groceries. I'm going to read at least one chapter, maybe walk through some of the park, and then head home. I'll probably take transit home so I can enjoy the park more and not get too tired (my feet are really sore).

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/park.PNG" class="centre" alt="top left: looking at the sky through trees, bottom left: me holding the book in the park, right: a bird on a tree" width="75%" >}}

Oh! Two people told me they liked my dress :) which was nice.

## Evening üåö
| **Fun things completed** | **Chores completed** |
| --- | --- |
| rented physical book from library | took out recycling (there was so much) |
| reading and walking in the park  | organized & cleaned bathroom |
| briefly read in a cafe | took an everything shower in my clean bathroom |
| got an armour seed in RuneScape!!!! and new daily cg pb | vacuumed some rooms (I didn't want to bother the cats too much) |
| blocking my swatch (0.5) | cleaned the dining table |

I read a few chapters but struggled to get into the book. I don‚Äôt know if it was the book, the noise in the distance, or my sleepiness, so I decided to head home. I ended up stopping by another cafe for an icy drink cause I was thirsty post coffee and read another chapter before taking transit home.

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/bookcafe.jpg" class="centre" width="50%" alt="me reading chapter 3 in a cafe with a raspberry shake" >}}

I did a little bit of runescape when I got home as a little treat for finally going to the library, and to rest a bit. I got an armour seed, which puts me at 4/6! I‚Äôve really only done gauntlet this weekend, I have the bowfa and the legs are close now I‚Äôm so motivated. Today I also beat my daily record (I did 15!).

Interlude: I realize I have a weird combination of hobbies. I don‚Äôt really expect anyone to understand all my references to knitting, reading, runescape, sewing‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I write what I want haha, I‚Äôm not trying to make a knitting blog or a runescape blog, I‚Äôm trying to make an Ena blog :) so I put what I want I guess!

Then I forced myself to take a break (I really just wanted to keep grinding for the drop I want) and made my grocery list and did the groceries.

Grocery list

- for potato salad (ill probably made it monday so alex can have some)
    - 2 large potatoes
    - 1  medium cucumber
    - corn
    - ham
    - Kewpie mayonnaise (if they have it)
- sausages (to go with potato salad? or something else) - food monday
- fish (to go with my leftover rice from yesterday - food saturday)
- something to eat on sunday (a form of pasta?)

Grocery shopping was quick but also I had to wait at FOUR (4) individual counters!!

1. pasta counter
2. deli counter
3. fish counter
4. meat counter

so I‚Äôm a bit drained. I like to call myself an introverted extrovert, if I spend a lot of time alone I go stir crazy (that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing this whole thing - all my friends are out of town!) but also talking to too many people, especially people I don‚Äôt know, leaves me mentally exhausted. It was only after the grocery store plus the bagel place plus the library plus the cafe that I started overthinking my interview again. Or all the interviews I‚Äôve been doing recently. Or my current job. You know, the normal or whatever.

After I put the groceries away I organized and lightly cleaned the bathroom. I actually remembered to take before/after pics, so here‚Äôs the closet I improved. I‚Äôve been thinking about reorganizing this to be more useful for ages and now I‚Äôve finally done it, woo:

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/bathroomcloset.PNG" width="75%" class="centre" alt="before/after of me cleaning the bathroom closet" >}}

I did a little bit of extra cleaning: vacuuming in the rooms the cats weren‚Äôt sleeping in, wiping down surfaces and the dining table better, sweeping up cat litter. Generally the apartment is already in a WAY better state than it was when Alex gets back. I can‚Äôt wait to surprise him! Haha, see how clean your home is, loser!!

Also I blocked my swatch:

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/blockedswatch.jpg" width="60%" class="centre" alt="my knitting swatch, now blocked" >}}

It's cotton yarn so I didn't expect a significant transformation and I was correct. But I did learn that it has poor recovery on stretch on the ribbed part. I was considering doing the [fausta bralette](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fausta-bralette) with this yarn, and I think I've changed my mind. I'll do something not ribbed instead, and use a yarn with better stretch recovery (merino like the pattern?) instead.

I took my book to my friend‚Äôs place and cuddled her cat while I read another chapter. It was a lot nicer than scrolling social media on my phone, and I stayed a bit longer than yesterday since she seems very lonely & bored. She seems less scared of me too!

Then I came home, did my physio, cooked my salmon with maple syrup and soy sauce and garlic and ate it on leftover rice. I accidentally have way too much salmon and rice, which is ruining my food plans. I think instead I will do:

| **Day** | **Friday** | **Saturday** | **Sunday** | **Monday** | **Tuesday** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lunch | idk i don‚Äôt remember | bagels! | leftover half of blueberry & strawberry bagel | leftover pasta | idk |
| Dinner | curry | salmon and leftover rice | fettucini with tuna, alfredo, pesto | leftover salmon and leftover^2 rice | potato salad and sausages with alex |

I don‚Äôt really eat breakfast beyond coffee and maybe a snack. Also I was going to take photos of all my meals, but I haven‚Äôt done many. I‚Äôll try to remember for the rest of the weekend.

And I think my general focus for the rest of the weekend is:

| **Day** | **Friday** | **Saturday** | **Sunday** | **Monday** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fun | Knitting | Library/reading | Sewing | Potato salad, finalize this post |
| Chore | Laundry, kitchen | Bedroom | Pick a room to focus on (undecided) | Pick a room to focus on (undecided) |

I‚Äôm gonna relax with my friends on discord for the rest of the night. Maybe I‚Äôll get some knitting done (I didn‚Äôt do any today, but I‚Äôm so close to finishing my sleeve!) (update: I did do a little knitting! found a mistake and spend 40 minutes fixing it whoops), but I did a lot of other things I wanted to so I‚Äôm happy. Although maybe I‚Äôm not really, I‚Äôm stressed about all the things I wanted to do this weekend (I haven‚Äôt sewn in days but my shorts are so close to being done!). So I think I‚Äôll try and focus sewing tomorrow, since I haven‚Äôt done any yet.

This ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù is going pretty well. I make lists (mentally & physically) a lot, but I rarely remember to come back and look at them, so this is doing great for me! I was looking at some of the chore ideas I had on Friday I already forgot about.

Goodnight üôÇ

# Sunday

## ~~Morning ‚òÄÔ∏è~~

## Evening üåö

| Fun things completed | Chores completed |
| --- | --- |
| A lot of runescape (oops) | Organized my closet (multiple points) |
| Knitting progress (not that much) |  |
| Read with my friend‚Äôs cat |  |

I didn‚Äôt write an entry this morning. I woke up not feeling the best, physically or mentally, and saw my friends playing runescape and I made the intentional choice to just hang out and chill for a bit. Is it better because I intentionally decided ‚Äútoday isn‚Äôt the best day, fuck it‚Äù? Than just accidentally slipping into it, keeping telling myself I‚Äôm going to stop, and then not stop?

Also the air quality was poor out today. My walk to my friend‚Äôs yesterday left my lungs burning, I hadn‚Äôt noticed it worsen (I have asthma) so I decided not to go the park. If it‚Äôs better out tomorrow, I‚Äôll go, but I‚Äôd rather not hurt my lungs.

Around noonish I was getting a bit headachy (I should wear my glasses more; I‚Äôm only +0.5 but I can start feeling pain in the eyes if I spend too long looking at screens. Usually I‚Äôm fine, but I guess it‚Äôs been a pretty online weekend despite all the effort I‚Äôve put.) So I took a break, I could‚Äôve written my morning entry but I wasn‚Äôt feeling it. I did a little bit of knitting with Zlatko, before he decided my knitting was a cat bed and I could no longer use it.

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/zknitting.jpg" width="75%" alt="zlatko sleeping on my sweater I've been working on" class="centre" >}}

Then I got motivated to finally tackle my closet. This was a long time coming, honestly. I was struggling to find clothes I like, despite it being so full, also I've gained some weight due to being less physically active due to my back (months of bed rest will do that to you!). I even took before and after photos again! A lot of the motivation was just to take pictures of when it was done, so it was fun to compare.

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/closet.PNG" width="75%" alt="before and after organizing closet" class="centre" >}}

This was a really big task though, it took me multiple hours and had multiple steps:

- Take everything out & vacuum the closet
    - Zlatko likes to sleep in the back of my closet under the clothes and on the ikea cloth boxes. I had to really vacuum a lot of cat hair
- Try everything on, divide into piles:
    1. Keep: This is straightforward.
    2. Sentimental: Goes to storage.
    3. No longer fits: Things I still really like but don‚Äôt fit comfortably instead. Keep for now and reevaluate later, I expect to lose some weight since I‚Äôm more active these days. Goes to storage.
    4. Minor fixes needed: a strap is fraying, or the sleeves are too long, or the sleeves are too tight. Things that are minor issues for me to fix and I still really like them despite small fit issues (maybe would be a fun post in the future when I tackle it!)
    5. Future sewing projects: Fabrics I like but not fits I like (colour, fibre content), either for upcycling or patchwork projects. For example, I have a nice cotton cardigan but I hate wearing cardigans, and it‚Äôs very long so it‚Äôs a lot of fabric. I could make something I‚Äôd actually wear out of it.
    6. Donate/sell: Nice/brand stuff I‚Äôll probably try to sell somehow, the rest goes to a donation bin
- Fold everything into nice piles, put away in closet or in donation bags or into longterm storage

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/clothespiles.PNG" width="75%" class="centre" alt="the above piles as described with labels" >}}

I spent a while trying to find the best organizational method that would be the most useful and easy for me to see and use. I had to be a bit honest with myself; I work from home and spend most of my time in pyjamas. Those things need to be the most accessible. I‚Äôm really happy with it, I‚Äôm less sad about clothes I like not fitting because I‚Äôm not constantly looking at them. Now when I try to get dressed, I know the pair of pants I think about putting on will fit on me, instead of trying on multiple pairs until I find one that fits. Honestly, the ‚Äúnot fitting‚Äù ones still physically fit, but they‚Äôre uncomfortable to lounge around in, so I think I‚Äôll be able to wear them again soon, but I‚Äôm happy to have them out of the way for now.

I did make sure Zlatko still had a spot to nap in the closet in.

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/zlatkocloset.jpg" width="50%" class="centre" alt="zlatko sleeping on a blanket in the back of my closet" >}}

Then I was really tired so I ate dinner: pasta with tuna, alfredo, and pesto - I even took a photo! (edit: no I didn't? am I losing it? there's no photo on my phone). This is my favourite go-to tired recipe. It‚Äôs so easy, and the alfredo & pesto are optional additions, so just a can of (oily required, water based doesn‚Äôt coat the pasta nicely) tuna and spaghetti, my peak comfort food.

Then I put on my mask and went over to hang out with my friend‚Äôs cat again. It was kind of creepy how empty it was out, I‚Äôd never seen the trail near my house empty. Especially not at 7pm on a Sunday, there‚Äôs constantly tons of people walking or biking. The low quality of air is starting to really become a problem üòï Well, I read two chapters and then headed home, did my physio exercises, and a bit more gauntlet in runescape. 

At this point I really wanted to keep going at gauntlet, in fact I made a great meme!

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/meme.png" width="50%" class="centre" alt="a deep friend meme saying THE VOICES / THEY ARE SAY TO DO CG" >}}

But my hands started hurting. My goal for the weekend really was to do 50 cg but also get other things done (not from day 1; not sure when I came up with this plan mentally, but an armour seed is 1 in 50 and I NEED ONE MORE) and I‚Äôm at 37/50 so I don‚Äôt know if I will achieve that. 

My clicking fingers are starting to struggle to keep up, I play runescape a lot it‚Äôs been a more ***INTENSE*** gaming this weekend than usual, since I‚Äôve been playing less total so whenever I do play I‚Äôm doing gauntlet and clicking a lot. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve dealt with hand pains actually, like 2 months? I think that's pretty good, especially since knitting also strains my hands, usually I get shoulder/neck pain. So I might not be able to do any tomorrow, but I also haven‚Äôt done any sewing this weekend so maybe I‚Äôll make the time to do that (and read) tomorrow.

But more importantly, tomorrow I am going to make my potato salad!! I am determined!! That is priority number 1, above all else. And a walk to the park, if the air quality is decent, but obviously my health is more important.

It‚Äôs only a holiday in Canada tomorrow so my friends went to bed early. I might finish my drink and read another chapter of my book, although maybe that‚Äôs a bad idea because it‚Äôs getting a bit spooky. I am struggling to get into the book a bit, it‚Äôs kind of a very slow start, I‚Äôm hopeful things will start happening soon. I‚Äôm getting a bit tired of the ‚Äúsilly british people in foreign countries!‚Äù trope, but this book does seem to have more than that so I'm suspending my review.

# Monday

## Morning ‚òÄÔ∏è

Last day of this adventure and it‚Äôs the only day I‚Äôve actually started writing the morning entry in the morning before I got out of bed! So I guess this will be a short update, because I haven‚Äôt done anything.

Zlatko was very cute this morning, he purred a lot and we cuddled for a long time. He also screamed at me overnight, like he has the last couple nights. I don‚Äôt know why he keeps screaming in the morning, 75% of the time it‚Äôs because he wants attention, but the other 25% he leaves and if you follow him he just stands in the middle of the living room. He hasn‚Äôt been fed in the morning for over 2 years at this point, I thought he had learned better.

My hands feel a bit sore; I think I need to give up on my gauntlet dreams, I just want to be done. I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to finish my sweater, although I am so close! I can‚Äôt decide if the sleeve length is good, it‚Äôs a good length when I'm standing straight but when I raise my arms it rides up. I think I can just make the ribbing a bit longer, although I'll have to redo my castoff edge.

I think I‚Äôll make a coffee and do a little bit of sewing. I also want to organize my fabric stash, because I know I have some finished items buried in there that I also need to declutter like I did my closet yesterday.

Oh I just remembered I need to go back and add photos and edit this‚Ä¶ I should do that today. Haha, I really don‚Äôt want to. Maybe I‚Äôm not cut out for this, or maybe I‚Äôll do it tuesday afternoon. The last day of a nice break sucks, back to work tomorrow üòü I wish Alex would be back before then, but he probably won‚Äôt be back until tuesday evening.

## Evening üåö

I did make progress on my sewing for about 2 hours! I finished one side of the split side bloomers, so all I have left is the other side, hemming, and adding gathers (elastic) to the legs. I have been kinda winging the construction, not taking as much care as I should. It‚Äôs hard to make myself care when it‚Äôs something that would never be visible (but would be very cute to wear under a dress!), and because it‚Äôs been my current WIP for so long. I do want to try to be more slow and mindful when sewing, taking the time to make things pretty, but I also think it‚Äôs ok to have some projects that you just don‚Äôt care as much as a breather.

Unfortunately, I crashed out a bit afterwards. I guess the last day feels a bit melancholy, and a friends said something that hurt me, so I didn‚Äôt really do much but knit for the rest of the day. I did force myself to make the [potato salad](https://youtu.be/gieX2LksCYU), which was some fun, but that faded quick. I also gathered a bit of motivation to take an inventory of my fabric stash, which is less than 2 boxes! (although I have more fabric on the way‚Ä¶) which was quick but was also something I‚Äôd been procrastinating.

I checked on my friend‚Äôs cat, read 2 more chapters. The book is starting to get interesting, but I‚Äôm struggling to connect with the writing a bit. Maybe now that things are picking up a bit, I can get more drawn in. I didn‚Äôt do my physio today, my legs were pretty sore from yesterday‚Äôs clothing marathon, and I only did the one walk to my friend‚Äôs place and back due to continued poor air quality. I‚Äôm sad I didn‚Äôt get to go the park, I really want to spend more time outside. I wish I had a backyard just to relax in, without it having to be an entire affair of planning and walking to the park. One day right? that‚Äôs the dream...

I got home and I was still feeling meh, so I decided fuck it I‚Äôm going to knit and watch TV or something. I‚Äôve been watching a lot of youtube all weekend, and sometimes I feel like the super engaging & informative content, while good and I love it, eventually leaves my brain a bit deep fried. A narrative is a bit slower, with moments to breathe, and I probably need that.

Luckily, Riki rose to the occasion and snuggled up on top of me the moment I‚Äôd gotten set up. She proceeded to be an adorable hindrance to my knitting, which obviously I did not mind. She played with my yarn, delivered a thousand licks, and slept peacefully. She really helped soothe me, I love my little void, she always knows when I need her most.

I finished the second sleeve, and unraveled the castoff edge of the first one. Here's the final state of the sweater after the week, I think I got a lot done! I'm like 5 rows and 2 castoffs away from being done (don't include weaving in the ends and the final block).

{{< figure src="/augustlongweekend/sweater3.jpg" alt="The sweater with only a few rows left on the sleeve" class="centre" width="75%" >}}

I watched the first three episode of Bucaneers. I expected it to be like Bridgerton, which to be fair it was in a lot of ways, wow the historical inaccuracies! But obviously that isn‚Äôt the goal, and I‚Äôm kind of obsessed with the Duke. He‚Äôs so sweet compared to the typical macho love interests, he‚Äôs kind of a glass of fresh air. I‚Äôm scared we‚Äôre so early in‚Ä¶ what other drama shall befall them? I know it'll get dumb and repetitive, I kind of wish it could've just ended with his cute as hell proposal.

Then I finished up the write up. So thanks for coming on this adventure with me! I‚Äôm going to go finish episode 3 and then go to sleep. My goal is to have this fully formatted with pictures by the time Alex gets home tomorrow because I want him to read it, but he‚Äôs got a long drive so I don‚Äôt expect him to be home before 9pm so I‚Äôll have plenty of time.

It makes sense I got more chores done, they're quicker than my fun ideas usually (finishing an entire sewing project is a lot more work than going grocery shopping). I am sad I didn‚Äôt get more done, but also I got a lot done so I think I‚Äôm just going to call this weekend a success, even if mentally I wasn‚Äôt really there. 

It upsets me that I spend so much time of my time & life thinking about all the creative things I want to do. I have so many projects planned, so many exciting things I want to do. But the motivation and the time are the hardest parts, but when I spend all my time thinking about these things I start to feel hopeless when it feels like progress is unattainable. Even when I have the time, motivation is near impossible. Sometimes it feels like why do I even try? But the moments I do get to create are so worth it. I struggle with focusing too much on the finished product, and not the journey it took me to get there, I need to work on this. The deadline of seasons is stressful and overwhelming, but without deadlines I struggle to get things done, so it's hard to fully give them up.

I know I'm a bit neurotic, I was way worse in school. I guess I'm still learning at 28 how to correctly pace myself.

Maybe we‚Äôll do this again on another long weekend, maybe one where I‚Äôm less stressed and I have more actual things planned! I probably would've been more inspired to work on my projects if I had friends to craft with.

Oh by the way: I got a follow-up interview from the one I had Friday, so I guess I did well enough! The next interview is technical, which I‚Äôm dreading to even book, but I guess I should probably focus on that over the next couple days. I‚Äôm just hoping for the anxiety to go away.

There was a lot of times during the week where I considered abandoning this project, especially on Monday. I really find my creative motivations are like a rollercoaster, and I'm getting better at acknowledging the lows so I can be ready for the highs. I was kind of dreading finalizing this write up and prepping all the photos, but I turned on some music and plugged my laptop into my monitor (I rarely use my desk properly) and got it done while baking bread. It was cozy, and I do feel more motivated to try and add more of my thousands of ideas to this blog.

Zlatko just wants to add that the sweater is his until I finish his blanket. I'll cast that on soon, I promise Zlatko, don't ruin all my knitted clothes please.

(edit: I did finish this before Alex got back! I probably won't force it on him tonight, I'll maybe send it to him on his lunch break tomorrow hehe)

(also I‚Äôll add a little edit here with my book review once I finish it!)

(edit: I finished the book! I had to force myself to, unfortunately. The book was boring, and I never got invested in the characters. Maybe it was written for a lower age level, but I felt like a lot was missing and the atmosphere failed to capture me. On to the next one!)
